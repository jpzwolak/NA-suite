# SNA toolbox

This repository is intended to provide the Physics Education Community (PER) with simple and intuitive `R` code to analyze and visualize social network data.

The network analysis of data and all networks visualizations presented in the `SNA_analysis.pdf` documents were done using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) statistical programming language. The document itself was generated with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). While `RStudio` is not required for the analysis, it makes working with the `R` code easier, especially for novice users.
