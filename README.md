# SNA toolbox

This repository is intended to provide the Physics Education Community (PER) with simple and intuitive `R` code to analyze and visualize social network data.

The network analysis of data and all networks visualizations presented in the `SNA_analysis.pdf` documents were done using the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) statistical programming language. The document itself was generated with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). While `RStudio` is not required for the analysis, it makes working with the `R` code easier, especially for novice users.

Presently the code allows for simple analysis of the basic network topology measures (e.g., diameter, density, average path lenght) as well as some simple network visualizations.

Any questions or concerns regarding the provided code and requests for additional fetures should be addressed to me at jpzwolak {at} gmail {.} com

Enjoy!
